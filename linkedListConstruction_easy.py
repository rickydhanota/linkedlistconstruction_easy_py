# Linked List construction

#Write a DoublyLinkedList class that has a head and a tail, both of which point to either a linked list Node or None/null. The class should support:
#   -Setting the head and tail of the linked list
#   -Inserting the nodes before and after the other nodes as well as at given positions (the position of the head node is 1)
#   -Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values
#   -Searching for nodes with given values
